# Luis Berrios 11/4/21 Create a program that calaculates distance of a suspened opject falling given a user input gravity constant and time.
print("This program will calculate the distance a suspened object falls","given a gravity and time")

import math
gravity=input("What do you want for gravity")
gravity=int("gravity")
fps=input("What is fps")
fps=int("fps")
frame=input("What is frame")
frame=int("frame")
time=frame/fps
distance=.5*gravity*time**2
print("It will drop", distance, "pixels in", time, "seconds")
